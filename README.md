MapReduce
=========

Implementations of different Map Reduce algorithms, that were run of large datasets. 

The algorithms implemented are WordCount, PhraseFrequency, and PageRank. 

The WordCount and PhraseFrequency were executed on the Twitter MemeTracker Dataset, to find the most popular words and phrases in the dataset.

The PageRank algorithm was executed on the Wikipedia PageLink dataset. This implementation of PageRank consists of two classes: ParseDataet.java and PageRank.java. Since the Wikipedia dataset was cluttered with extraneious information, the important data had to be parsed into a more easily scannable format. Then PageRank was executed on the parsed dataset.
